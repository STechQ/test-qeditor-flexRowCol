1. timer.start() method calls a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). The start() method will continue calling the function until stop() is called, or the window is closed.
2. timer.stop() method clears a timer set with the start() method.
3. timer.reStart method calls timer.stop() and timer.start() respectively.
