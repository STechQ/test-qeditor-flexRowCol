## VExpansionPanels

The v-expansion-panel component is useful for reducing vertical space with large amounts of information. The default functionality of the component is to only display one expansion-panel body at a time; however, with the multiple property, the expansion-panel can remain open until explicitly closed. See the [component page](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/expansion-panels/)
